a: 4, b: 7
a: 7, b: 4

This code is creating a class called Test which has two variables, a and b. It then creates an instance of the Test class called p, which has the values 4 and 7 assigned to a and b respectively. It then prints out the values of a and b, and then calls the swap() method which swaps the values of a and b. Finally, it prints out the new values of a and b.
